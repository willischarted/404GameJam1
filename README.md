Game Jam theme: Heat

A pvp brawler where two players face off as snowballs in an arena. As the players move around, they grow larger, heavier but slower. Moving nearer to the fire reduces their size and weght but makes them more nimble. The goal is to know the other player out of the arena by colliding with them all the while strategically growing and shrinking for an advantage.
